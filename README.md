# Personalized-Fitness-Nutrition-Tracker-Python-
Developed a Python-based application that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI), daily calorie needs, and personalized protein intake based on user-specific data such as age, gender, activity level, and fitness goals.

Implemented interactive exercise logging functionality, allowing users to record workouts (exercise name, sets, reps), enabling detailed tracking of fitness progress and improving user engagement.
